    my_love_for_python += 1
    my_python_knowledge += 1
```

I love Python so much, here is some code with some colour coded syntax!

```python
my_love_for_python = 0
my_python_knowledge = 0

for day in lifetime:
    my_love_for_python += 1
    my_python_knowledge += 1  
```

    * Computer Vision
    * Projects about coffee

Here is an _ordered list_ showing some things I love about coffee

1. The smell
    1. Especially in the morning
2. The taste
3. The fact I can run the 100m in about 9 seconds after having 4 cups in quick succession

I love Python & Coffee so much, here is that picture from the top again, but this time, in the body of my project!

The above image is just linked to the actual file in my Github, but I could also link to images online, using the URL!

A line break, like this one below - helps me make sense of what I reading, especially when I've had so much coffee that my vision goes a little blurry

I could also add things to my project like links, tables, quotes, and HTML blocks - but I'm started to get a headache.  I think it's coffee time.
