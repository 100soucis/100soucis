Syntax highlighting is a feature that displays source code, in different colors and fonts according to the category of terms. This feature facilitates writing in a structured language such as a programming language or a markup language as both structures and syntax errors are visually distinct. Highlighting does not affect the meaning of the text itself; it is intended only for human readers.[^1]

### Code Blocks in Lists

Indentation matters. Be sure the indent of the code block aligns with the first non-space character after the list item marker (e.g., `1.`). Usually this will mean indenting 3 spaces instead of 4.

1. Do step 1.
2. Now do this:

   ```ruby
   def print_hi(name)
     puts "Hi, #{name}"
   end
   print_hi('Tom')
   #=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
   ```
   
   ``
   def myFunc()
      x = 10
      return x
   ``
